# RGSHueView

A while back I created RGSColorSlider and while creating it I used an image for the color gradient track. Using an image is not ideal, but, at the time, assessable. While browsing Github one day I stumble across [GradientProgressView]. [GradientProgressView] in it’s own right is a cool project, but what was surprising is the creation of a hue gradient purely in code. I really liked this solution so much I decide to create it in swift.

Simply added RGSHueView.swift to your project then declare your UIView as RGSHueView and you’re good to.
